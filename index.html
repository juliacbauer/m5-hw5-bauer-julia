                <p>Hello! My name is Julia Bauer, and I am a fourth-year journalism major at the University of Florida. I am from Tampa. I grew up with my mom, dad, and younger brother, Chad. They are some of my best friends. The photo of me is from the summer when my family and I drove through Mosquito Pass in Colorado. That is definitely one of the coolest places I've ever been. I also have a dog named Rico. I was a dancer from ages 2 to 18. I loved going to dance competitions, and I miss dance a lot. I had to stop dancing after high school because I dislocated my knee and tore my MCL three times. I'm pretty sure I have bursitis now, but it's OK. Besides dance, I love drawing, painting, reading and traveling. My favorite thing ever is the beach. I love swimming in the ocean. One time I found a baby seahorse. That is one of my favorite memories. I also love music. Tyler, The Creator, Childish Gambino, MF DOOM, Alex G, Current Joys, and No Doubt are some of my favorite artists. I'm really into 80s music right now. I can't stop listening to Love Shack by the B-52s, Rock the Casbah by The Clash, Canary in a Coalmine by The Police, and Rebel Yell by Billy Idol.</p>
                <p>As far as academics and career goals go, I love writing. I write for three magazines right now and I love it. I also like to write poetry. But, because I really like art, I decided to join the combined degree program to learn web design. I thought that was a good way to combine the skills I have learned through journalism with my passion for art. One thing I will say is that I hate how AP Style is anti-Oxford comma. Anyway, learning how to code has been really fun so far. I have no idea what my dream job is. I thought I wanted to make documentaries because I really like video editing and using Premiere Pro, but to be honest, I should have majored in telecom if I wanted to do that. As I'm writing this, I realized that I enjoy learning about the innerworkings of things, like with video editing and coding. I can spend hours doing that stuff.</p>
